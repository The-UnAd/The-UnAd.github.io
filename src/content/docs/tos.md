# Terms of Service

By using the UnAd service, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the service. You’re not allowed to copy or modify any part of the service or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the service, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the service into other languages, or make derivative versions. The service itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to UnAd.

UnAd is committed to ensuring that the service is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the service or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the service or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The UnAd service stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the service secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the UnAd service won’t work properly or at all.

The service does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.

You should be aware that there are certain things that UnAd will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the service will require the service to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but UnAd cannot take responsibility for the service not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the service outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the service, or other third party charges. In using the service, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the service outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the service, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the service.

Along the same lines, UnAd cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the service i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, UnAd cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to UnAd’s responsibility for your use of the service, when you’re using the service, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. UnAd accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the service.
